## Digital Developer & Designer
Currently pursuing a Fullstack Development program at Kodehode, Bergen.

I'm pretty good at C# and have quite a bit of experience with game development engines like Unity and Godot. I'm also well-versed in many design tools, including most of the Adobe Creative Suite. While my HTML/CSS skills are still developing, I am getting better day by day!

At Kodehode, I'm focusing on enhancing my frontend design skills and gaining deeper knowledge of backend server management. In my personal time, I explore new techniques and technologies, and I'm currently working with Unreal Engine on personal projects.

Beyond development, I have extensive experience in audio production, including performing, recording, and mixing music. Iâ€™m also passionate about visual arts, with skills in both digital and traditional drawing and painting.

I'm currently working on my frontend design skills, as well as backend server management through Kodehode. On my own, I'm always looking to incoroporate new techniques in my personal projects. Right now, I'm working with Unreal Engine.

As for other skills, I have a good bit of experience with audio and music, both performing and recording & mixing. I also love to draw and paint, both digital and traditional.
