## Digital Developer & Designer
Currently pursuing a Fullstack Development program at Kodehode, Bergen.

I have strong proficiency in C# and significant experience with game development engines like Unity and Godot. I'm also well-versed in design tools, including most of the Adobe Creative Suite. While my HTML/CSS skills are still developing, I am continuously improving and actively working on mastering these technologies.

At Kodehode, Iâ€™m focusing on enhancing my frontend design skills and gaining deeper knowledge of backend server management. In my personal time, I explore new techniques and technologies, and Iâ€™m currently working with Unreal Engine on personal projects.

Beyond development, I have extensive experience in audio production, including performing, recording, and mixing music. Iâ€™m also passionate about visual arts, with skills in both digital and traditional drawing and painting.
