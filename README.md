## Developer & Designer
Currently studying fullstack development at Kodehode, Bergen.
I'm pretty good at C# and some game engines. I also do well with designs, and most of the Adobe suite. 
My HTML/CSS might need some work, but... It's getting there. 

As for other skills, I have a good bit of experience with audio and music, both performing and recording & mixing.
